When I started out on the 1:2 scale Phoenix project, I had a few goals in mind

* Document as much as possible
* Demonstrate advanced techniques where appropriate
* Stay true to scale

I think I'm happy with the results for each of these.

## Documentation

During the build, I certainly satisfied part of this goal. I have 100s of photos along with several videos that capture the build steps as well as templates, STLs etc. for many of the components.

The entire rocket is modelled in Fusion360 with SVGs and STLs generated from the models.

The files supporting the build will be available in the [project GitHub repo](https://github.com/rlhatcher/phoenix)

## Advanced Techniques

This build benefited from several techniques that will appear in the [build section](/build/phoenix) of the project.

Some of these techniques are

* Tip to tip fibreglass
* 3D nose cone modelling
* 3D printed functional parts
* Finish and paint

It's a lot to pack into one rocket, but this is a great candidate and the Loc kit is a great starting point.

## True to scale

One of the more interesting aspects of the build has been the research I've done on the missile. I have collected a fairly large set of drawings, documents and photographs and have started collecting these in the [Project Section](/project/phoenix).

I decided to focus the build on this missile since I have a left and right side of this specific serno.
